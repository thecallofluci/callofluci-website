## Blog entries

- Blog posts should be markdown files, stored in the `/src/posts` folder
- Filename must take the pattern of `YYYY-MM-DD-chosen-post-title.md`
- Front matter should take the shape of the following interface:

  ```ts
  interface BlogPostFrontmatter {
    layout?: string
    title: string
    date: string
    author: string
    category: Category
  }
  ```

  (See [src/interfaces.ts](src/interfaces.ts) for canonical `BlogPostFrontmatter` interface.)

- `Category` must take one of the following values:

  - `Releases`
  - `Security Alerts`
  - `Announcements`
  - `Explainers`

  (See [src/constants.ts](src/constants.ts) and [src/interfaces.ts](src/interfaces.ts) for canonical `Category` enum.)

- `title` property will be displayed automatically as an `<h1>` (`#` in markdown), and should not be included in the markdown bodyâ€”start document header levels from `<h2>` (`##`)
- `date` property should be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- MDX/JSX is not currently supported
- Images can be placed in a corresponding folder within `/public/img` and references using `![alt text](/img/chosen-folder/image-name.png)`

## Adding internal links

When linking to content internal to this repo, relative paths should be used instead of absolute paths. This ensures proper routing with Next.js, and avoids unintentional page refreshes.

This includes links to blog posts, which now live under https://callofluci.art/blog/ and should be referenced using `/blog/YYYY/MM-DD/post-name/`, _without_ `https://callofluci.art`.

This does NOT include links to the docs, which are located at a different subdomain of https://docs.callofluci.art. These should be referenced using their full URL, including `https://docs.callofluci.art`.
