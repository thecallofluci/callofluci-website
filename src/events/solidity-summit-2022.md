The Solidity Summit is a collaborative event focusing on the future of Solidity.

## Thank you for joining Solidity Summit 2022!

Thank you so much for joining us in Amsterdam this year. We hope you had fun and
see you all soon!

You can rewatch all sessions by browsing through the YouTube playlist or watch
the entire stream on StreamETH.tv.

## Keep up with the newest developments in the Solidity space.

The Solidity Summit is a free interactive forum with discussions and talks on
Solidity, Yul, language design, security and tooling.

During the event you can expect to:

- Get up to speed with the latest language proposals and new features.
- Hear updates from Solidity tooling and security experts.
- Learn from Solidity power users.

We aim to have useful discussions that result in language improvement proposals
and ultimately in actual implementations. Furthermore, we want to foster
communication between teams working on similar topics, and identify needs for
the smart contract ecosystem of Ethereum.

## Wed, April 20 2022 - Tolhuistuin, Amsterdam

Solidity Summit 2022 is part of Devconnect Amsterdam and will be a one-day forum
for the Solidity ecosystem. It is for all people involved and interested in the
Solidity language and the tooling around it.

## Who can join?

The Solidity Summit focuses on advanced Solidity users and other stakeholders of
the Solidity ecosystem, such as tool builders, auditors and security
researchers.

### Solidity Language Shapers

You are a Solidity pro and interested in shaping the language? Join the Solidity
Summit to present language improvement proposals and exchange ideas.

### Tooling Builders & Auditors

You build an IDE, debugger, analysis tool or audit Solidity code? Use the
opportunity to share your tools and what you've been working on with the
audience.

### Solidity Enthusiasts

You are a heavy Solidity user? We welcome all Solidity power users and code
aficionados to join, learn, network and share their best Solidity tips, hacks
and feedback.

## What will we talk about?

This year, presentations and discussions will evolve around the following
topics:

- Solidity and Yul
- Language changes or extension proposals
- Upcoming new features
- Feedback on recently introduced features
- Unification / extension of the ABI
- Tooling, debuggers and debugging data output
- Testing frameworks
- Integration into existing "larger ecosystem tools" (e.g. VSCode via Language
  Server, LLVM)
- Source verification
- Layer 2 support, cross-chain support
- Mechanisms / programming patterns (on the EVM) like mutexes, state machines,
  upgradeable contracts, libraries, create2, etc.

## What does the program look like this year?

You can find a more detailed agenda with abstracts and speaker information here.
