## The Solidity Summit is a collaborative event focusing on the future of [Solidity](/).

We're excited to bring back Solidity Summit for another edition, again as part
of the [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/schedule) week!

Speaker and attendee applications for 2023 are now closed and ticket vouchers
have been distributed.

You can follow Solidity on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang) or
monitor the [Solidity blog](/blog) not to miss any updates about the event.

## Keep up with the newest developments in the Solidity space.

The Solidity Summit is a free interactive forum with discussions and talks on
Solidity, Yul, language design, security, and tooling.

During the event, you can expect to:

- Get up to speed with the latest language proposals and new features.
- Hear updates from Solidity tooling and security experts.
- Learn from Solidity power users.

We aim to have useful discussions that result in language improvement proposals
and, ultimately in actual implementations. Furthermore, we want to foster
communication between teams working on similar topics and identify needs for the
smart contract ecosystem of Ethereum.

Solidity Summit 2023 is part of [Devconnect Istanbul](https://devconnect.org/)
and will be a one-day forum for the Solidity ecosystem. It is for all people
involved and interested in the Solidity language and the tooling around it.

## Who can join?

The Solidity Summit focuses on advanced Solidity users and other stakeholders of
the Solidity ecosystem, such as tool builders, auditors, and security
researchers.

#### Solidity Language Shapers

Experts in Solidity, or other EVM smart contract languages, can share updates,
or present improvement ideas and their thoughts.

#### Tooling Builders & Auditors

IDE developers, debuggers, analysis tools, or testing frameworks can use this
occasion to share updates with the audience.

#### Solidity Enthusiasts

Seasoned Solidity users can share their finest Solidity hacks, tips, and
comments!

## What will we talk about?

This year, presentations and discussions will revolve around the following
topics:

- Solidity and Yul
- Language changes or extension proposals
- Long-term future of Solidity (Verkle tree support, experimental Solidity,
  etc.)
- Feedback on recently introduced features
- Unification/extension of the ABI
- Tooling, debuggers and debugging data output
- Testing frameworks
- Source verification
- Layer 2 support, cross-chain support
- Mechanisms/programming patterns (on the EVM) like mutexes, state machines,
  upgradeable contracts, libraries, create2, etc.

## Registrations are now closed!

Tickets for the Solidity Summit 2023 are free and were given out on an
application basis. Applications are now closed.

If you received a ticket voucher via the application process, please make sure
to redeem it in our [ticket shop](https://ticketh.xyz/solidity/summit/) as soon
as possible to ensure a spot at the event.

The Solidity Summit is focused on an advanced audience and is not suitable for
beginners who are just getting started with (Solidity) programming.

## Can't attend?

Can't make it to Istanbul in person? No worries, the event will be live-streamed
and recorded. Before the event, we'll send out instructions on how to join us
online. To view the live stream, you do not need to sign up.
