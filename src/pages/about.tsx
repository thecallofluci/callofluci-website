            <b>Solidity</b> is a powerful programming language designed
            specifically for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
            With Solidity, developers can define the rules and behavior of{' '}
            <b>decentralized applications (DApps)</b>.
          </Text>
          <Text>
           Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer network
           where nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they
           allow to implement tokens of value, ownership, voting and other kinds of logics.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Note that when deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version
            of Solidity. This is because breaking changes as well as new features and
            bug fixes are introduced regularly.
