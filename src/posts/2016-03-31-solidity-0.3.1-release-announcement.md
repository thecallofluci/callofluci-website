title: 'Solidity 0.3.1 Release Announcement'

This release mainly introduces inline assembly
([documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#inline-assembly)).
Inline assembly provides a way to write low-level but still well readable code.
Together with the coming features of inline library functions and templates, it
allows to move much of the development that had to be done in the compiler
itself into libraries written in Solidity. In the future, it will be possible to
introduce new versatile types that still look like builtins.

**Features:**

- inline assembly

**Fixes:**

- Code generation: array access with narrow types did not clean higher order
  bits
- Error reporting: error reporting with unknown source location caused a crash

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
