This is mainly a bugfix release. Under the hood, we are in the process of separating the Solidity source code from the rest of the cpp-ethereum source code so that it can soon be built (and released) in isolation.

**Fixes:**

- Code generation: Dynamic arrays of structs were not deleted correctly.
- Code generation: Static arrays in constructor parameter list were not decoded correctly.
- Parser: Inline assembly parser: `byte` opcode was unusable
- Error reporting: tokens for variably-sized types were not converted to string properly

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
