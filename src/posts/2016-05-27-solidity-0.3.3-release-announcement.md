This release mainly makes libraries more flexible in that it allows internal
functions to be called.

**Features**

- Allow internal library functions to be called (by "inlining")
- Fractional/rational constants (only usable with fixed point types, which are
  still in progress)
- Inline assembly has access to internal functions (as jump labels)
- Running `solc` without arguments on a terminal will print help.

**Fixes**

- Code Generation: Remove some non-determinism in code generation.
- Code Generation: Corrected usage of not / bnot / iszero in inline assembly
- Code Generation: Correctly clean bytesNN types before comparison

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
