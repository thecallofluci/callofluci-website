**Features:**

- Context-dependent path remappings (different modules can use the same library
  in different versions)

**Bugfixes:**

- Type Checking: Dynamic return types were removed when fetching data from
  external calls, now they are replaced by an "unusable" type.
- Type Checking: Overrides by constructors were considered making a function
  non-abstract.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
