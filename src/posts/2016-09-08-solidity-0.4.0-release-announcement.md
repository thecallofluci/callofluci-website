title: 'Solidity 0.4.0 Release Announcement'
date: '2016-09-08'
author: Solidity Team
category: Releases
---

**Note:** Version 0.4.0 is unable to compile libraries. Please upgrade to 0.4.1.

This release deliberately breaks backwards compatibility mostly to enforce some
safety features. The most important change is that you have to explicitly
specify if functions can receive ether via the `payable` modifier. Furthermore,
more situations cause exceptions to be thrown.

**Minimal changes to be made for upgrade:**

- Add `payable` to all functions that want to receive Ether (including the
  constructor and the fallback function).
- Change `_` to `_;` in modifiers.
- Add version pragma to each file: `pragma solidity ^0.4.0;`

**Breaking Changes:**

- Source files have to specify the compiler version they are compatible with
  using e.g. `pragma solidity ^0.4.0;` or `pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.4.8;`
- Functions that want to receive Ether have to specify the new `payable`
  modifier (otherwise they throw).
- Contracts that want to receive Ether with a plain "send" have to implement a
  fallback function with the `payable` modifier. Contracts now throw if no
  payable fallback function is defined and no function matches the signature.
- Failing contract creation through "new" throws.
- Division / modulus by zero throws.
- Function call throws if target contract does not have code
- Modifiers are required to contain `_` (use `if (false) _` as a workaround if
  needed).
- Modifiers: return does not skip part in modifier after `_`.
- Placeholder statement `_` in modifier now requires explicit `;`.
- `ecrecover` now returns zero if the input is malformed (it previously returned
  garbage).
- The `constant` keyword cannot be used for constructors or the fallback
  function.
- Removed `interface` (Solidity interface) output option
- JSON AST: General cleanup, renamed many nodes to match their C++ names.
- JSON output: `srcmap-runtime` renamed to `srcmapRuntime`.
- Moved (and reworked) standard library contracts from inside the compiler to
  github.com/ethereum/solidity/std (`import "std";` or `import owned;` do not
  work anymore).
- Confusing and undocumented keyword `after` was removed.
- New reserved words: `abstract`, `hex`, `interface`, `payable`, `pure`,
  `static`, `view`.

**Features:**

- Hexadecimal string literals: `hex"ab1248fe"`
- Internal: Inline assembly usable by the code generator.
- Commandline interface: Using `-` as filename allows reading from stdin.
- Interface JSON: Fallback function is now part of the ABI.
- Interface: Version string now _semver_ compatible.
- Code generator: Do not provide "new account gas" if we know the called account
  exists.

**Bugfixes:**

- JSON AST: Nodes were added at wrong parent
- Why3 translator: Crash fix for exponentiation
- Commandline Interface: linking libraries with underscores in their name.
- Type Checker: Fallback function cannot return data anymore.
- Code Generator: Fix crash when `sha3()` was used on unsupported types.
- Code Generator: Manually set gas stipend for `.send(0)`.

Lots of changes to the documentation mainly by voluntary external contributors.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
