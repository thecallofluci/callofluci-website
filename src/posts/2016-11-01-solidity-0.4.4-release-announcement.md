This is a bugfix release that fixes a storage corruption that appears when multiple variables are stored in the same slot ([details](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2016/11/01/security-alert-solidity-variables-can-overwritten-storage/)).

**Bugfixes:**

- Type checker: forbid signed exponential that led to an incorrect use of EXP opcode.
- Code generator: properly clean higher order bytes before storing in storage.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
