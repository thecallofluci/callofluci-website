**Features:**

- Optimiser: Performance improvements.
- Output: Print assembly in new standardized Solidity assembly format.

**Bugfixes:**

- Remappings: Prefer longer context over longer prefix.
- Type checker, code generator: enable access to events of base contracts' names.
- Imports: `import ".dir/a"` is not a relative path. Relative paths begin with directory `.` or `..`.
- Type checker: disallow inheritances of different kinds (e.g. a function and a modifier) of members of the same name
