This release is focused on stability and also introduces some new smart contract
safety features: `require`, `assert` and `transfer`. Note that the new `revert`
function will only be gas-efficient starting from homestead.

**Features:**

- Add `assert(condition)`, which throws if condition is false (meant for
  internal errors).
- Add `require(condition)`, which throws if condition is false (meant for
  invalid input).
- Commandline interface: Do not overwrite files unless forced.
- Introduce `.transfer(value)` for sending Ether.
- Code generator: Support `revert()` to abort with rolling back, but not
  consuming all gas.
- Inline assembly: Support `revert` (EIP140) as an opcode.
- Parser: Support scientific notation in numbers (e.g. `2e8` and `200e-2`).
- Type system: Support explicit conversion of external function to address.
- Type system: Warn if base of exponentiation is literal (result type might be
  unexpected).
- Type system: Warn if constant state variables are not compile-time constants.

**Bugfixes:**

- Commandline interface: Always escape filenames (replace `/`, `:` and `.` with
  `_`).
- Commandline interface: Do not try creating paths `.` and `..`.
- Commandline interface: Allow long library names.
- Parser: Disallow octal literals.
- Type system: Fix a crash caused by continuing on fatal errors in the code.
- Type system: Disallow compound assignment for tuples.
- Type system: Detect cyclic dependencies between constants.
- Type system: Disallow arrays with negative length.
- Type system: Fix a crash related to invalid binary operators.
- Type system: Disallow `var` declaration with empty tuple type.
- Type system: Correctly convert function argument types to pointers for member
  functions.
- Type system: Move privateness of constructor into AST itself.
- Inline assembly: Charge one stack slot for non-value types during analysis.
- Assembly output: Print source location before the operation it refers to
  instead of after.
- Optimizer: Stop trying to optimize tricky constants after a while.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
