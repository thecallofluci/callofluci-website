This release fixes a bug in the optimizer (more about this on the [blog](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2017/05/03/solidity-optimizer-bug/)), introduces the standard JSON interface, adds `interface` contracts and implements some additional safety checks.

The standard [JSON interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description) provides a unified way to invoke the Solidity compiler in order to ease cross-platform adoption and compilation verification.

**Features:**

- Implement the Standard JSON Input / Output API
- Support `interface` contracts.
- C API (`jsonCompiler`): Add the `compileStandard()` method to process a Standard JSON I/O.
- Commandline interface: Add the `standard-json` parameter to process a Standard JSON I/O.
- Commandline interface: Support `allow-paths` to define trusted import paths. Note: the
  path(s) of the supplied source file(s) is always trusted.
- Inline Assembly: Storage variable access using `_slot` and `_offset` suffixes.
- Inline Assembly: Disallow blocks with unbalanced stack.
- Static analyzer: Warn about statements without effects.
- Static analyzer: Warn about unused local variables, parameters, and return parameters.
- Syntax checker: issue deprecation warning for unary '+'

**Bugfixes:**

- Assembly output: Implement missing AssemblyItem types.
- Compiler interface: Fix a bug where source indexes could be inconsistent between Solidity compiled
  with different compilers (clang vs. gcc) or compiler settings. The bug was visible in AST
  and source mappings.
- Gas Estimator: Reflect the most recent fee schedule.
- Type system: Contract inheriting from base with unimplemented constructor should be abstract.
- Optimizer: Number representation bug in the constant optimizer fixed.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
