This release introduces the AST export, solidifies inline assembly, introduces
some more warnings and fixes several bugs.

Manual jumps in assembly are deprecated in favour of the structured constructs
`switch`, `for` and function calls also to provide better portability in the
future.

**Features:**

- Assembly: Add `CREATE2` (EIP86), `STATICCALL` (EIP214), `RETURNDATASIZE` and
  `RETURNDATACOPY` (EIP211) instructions.
- Assembly: Display auxiliary data in the assembly output.
- Assembly: Renamed `SHA3` to `KECCAK256`.
- AST: export all attributes to JSON format.
- C API (`jsonCompiler`): Use the Standard JSON I/O internally.
- Code Generator: Added the Whiskers template system.
- Inline Assembly: `for` and `switch` statements.
- Inline Assembly: Function definitions and function calls.
- Inline Assembly: Introduce `keccak256` as an opcode. `sha3` is still a valid
  alias.
- Inline Assembly: Present proper error message when not supplying enough
  arguments to a functional instruction.
- Inline Assembly: Warn when instructions shadow Solidity variables.
- Inline Assembly: Warn when using `jump`s.
- Remove obsolete Why3 output.
- Type Checker: Enforce strict UTF-8 validation.
- Type Checker: Warn about copies in storage that might overwrite unexpectedly.
- Type Checker: Warn about type inference from literal numbers.
- Static Analyzer: Warn about deprecation of `callcode`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Assembly: mark `MLOAD` to have side effects in the optimiser.
- Code Generator: Fix ABI encoding of empty literal string.
- Code Generator: Fix negative stack size checks.
- Code generator: Use `REVERT` instead of `INVALID` for generated input
  validation routines.
- Inline Assembly: Enforce function arguments when parsing functional
  instructions.
- Optimizer: Disallow optimizations involving `MLOAD` because it changes
  `MSIZE`.
- Static Analyzer: Unused variable warnings no longer issued for variables used
  inside inline assembly.
- Type Checker: Fix address literals not being treated as compile-time
  constants.
- Type Checker: Fixed crash concerning non-callable types.
- Type Checker: Fixed segfault with constant function parameters
- Type Checker: Disallow comparisons between mapping and non-internal function
  types.
- Type Checker: Disallow invoking the same modifier multiple times.
- Type Checker: Do not treat strings that look like addresses as addresses.
- Type Checker: Support valid, but incorrectly rejected UTF-8 sequences.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
