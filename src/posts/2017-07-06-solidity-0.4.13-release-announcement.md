title: 'Solidity 0.4.13 Release Announcement'

This is a small bugfix release that fixes several trivial but very annoying bugs
that were introduced with 0.4.12. We also deprecate some old features in
preparation of the breaking release 0.5.0.

**Features:**

- Syntax Checker: Deprecated `throw` in favour of `require()`, `assert()` and
  `revert()`.
- Type Checker: Warn if a local storage reference variable does not explicitly
  use the keyword `storage`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Code Generator: Correctly unregister modifier variables.
- Compiler Interface: Only output AST if analysis was successful.
- Error Output: Do not omit the error type.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
