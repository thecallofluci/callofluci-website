This is mainly a bugfix release that corrects a problem with the return value of
the low-level `delegatecall` function and removes some invalid warning messages.

**Features:**

- Type Checker: Show unimplemented function if trying to instantiate an abstract
  class.

**Bugfixes:**

- Code Generator: `.delegatecall()` should always return execution outcome.
- Code Generator: Provide "new account gas" for low-level `callcode` and
  `delegatecall`.
- Type Checker: Constructors must be implemented if declared.
- Type Checker: Disallow the `.gas()` modifier on `ecrecover`, `sha256` and
  `ripemd160`.
- Type Checker: Do not mark overloaded functions as shadowing other functions.
- Type Checker: Internal library functions must be implemented if declared.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
