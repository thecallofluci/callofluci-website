As we are getting closer to the next breaking release, we want to give everyone
a heads up by introducing `pragma experimental "v0.5.0"` which already enables
some of the new safety features of the 0.5.0 release.

Furthermore, this release finally checks the modifiers `view` (used to be named
`constant`) and `pure` on functions. As a rule of thumb, use `view` if your
function does not modify storage and `pure` if it does not even read any state
information - but the compiler will also suggest the tightest restriction
itself.

We also worked further on the new ABI encoder: Functions can now return structs.
Switch it on using `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2`. It should already work,
but still generates more expensive code.

Finally, many new warnings were introduced and error messages improved.

**Features:**

- Assembly Parser: Support multiple assignment (`x, y := f()`).
- Code Generator: Keep a single copy of encoding functions when using the
  experimental "ABIEncoderV2".
- Code Generator: Partial support for passing `structs` as arguments and return
  parameters (requires `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;` for now).
- General: Support `pragma experimental "v0.5.0";` to activate upcoming breaking
  changes.
- General: Added `.selector` member on external function types to retrieve their
  signature.
- Optimizer: Add new optimization step to remove unused `JUMPDEST`s.
- Static Analyzer: Warn when using deprecated builtins `sha3` and `suicide`
  (replaced by `keccak256` and `selfdestruct`, introduced in 0.4.2 and 0.2.0,
  respectively).
- Syntax Checker: Warn if no visibility is specified on contract functions.
- Type Checker: Display helpful warning for unused function arguments/return
  parameters.
- Type Checker: Do not show the same error multiple times for events.
- Type Checker: Greatly reduce the number of duplicate errors shown for
  duplicate constructors and functions.
- Type Checker: Warn on using literals as tight packing parameters in
  `keccak256`, `sha3`, `sha256` and `ripemd160`.
- Type Checker: Enforce `view` and `pure`.
- Type Checker: Enforce `view` / `constant` with error as experimental 0.5.0
  feature.
- Type Checker: Enforce fallback functions to be `external` as experimental
  0.5.0 feature.

**Bugfixes:**

- ABI JSON: Include all overloaded events.
- Parser: Crash fix related to parseTypeName.
- Type Checker: Allow constant byte arrays.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
