title: 'Solidity 0.4.18 Release Announcement'
date: '2017-10-18'
author: Solidity Team

This release adds further backwards-incompatible security measures enabled via
`pragma experimental "v0.5.0";` and contains another important feature: You can
now select to compile only certain contracts using the `outputSelection` field
of the
[standard-json-io](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/using-the-compiler.html#input-description)
compiler interface, which should speed up tools like truffle tremendously.

There are also two important bug fixes: One was an oversight in the way `bytes`
variables are allocated in memory and can reduce the memory requirements
32-fold. The second is a security fix: In extremely specific circumstances, it
can happen that a regular function is called instead of the fallback function
for an Ether transfer without data. These circumstances are: The function has to
have a zero signature (one out of 4294967296), it has to be payable, the
contract cannot have more than five (external) functions and it cannot have a
fallback function.

**Features:**

- Code Generator: Always use all available gas for calls as experimental 0.5.0
  feature (previously, some amount was retained in order to work in
  pre-Tangerine-Whistle EVM versions)
- Parser: Better error message for unexpected trailing comma in parameter lists.
- Standard JSON: Support the `outputSelection` field for selective compilation
  of supplied sources.
- Syntax Checker: Unary `+` is now a syntax error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.
- Type Checker: Disallow non-pure constant state variables as experimental 0.5.0
  feature.
- Type Checker: Do not add members of `address` to contracts as experimental
  0.5.0 feature.
- Type Checker: Force interface functions to be external as experimental 0.5.0
  feature.
- Type Checker: Require `storage` or `memory` keyword for local variables as
  experimental 0.5.0 feature.

**Bugfixes:**

- Code Generator: Allocate one byte per memory byte array element instead of 32.
- Code Generator: Do not accept data with less than four bytes (truncated
  function signature) for regular function calls - fallback function is invoked
  instead.
- Optimizer: Remove unused stack computation results.
- Parser: Fix source location of VariableDeclarationStatement.
- Type Checker: Allow `gas` in view functions.
- Type Checker: Do not mark event parameters as shadowing state variables.
- Type Checker: Prevent duplicate event declarations.
- Type Checker: Properly check array length and don't rely on an assertion in
  code generation.
- Type Checker: Properly support overwriting members inherited from `address` in
  a contract (such as `balance`, `transfer`, etc.)
- Type Checker: Validate each number literal in tuple expressions even if they
  are not assigned from.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
