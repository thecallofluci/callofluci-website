author: Solidity Team

In the last weeks, we have mainly been working on big internal changes. One of
them is the new ABI decoder, which is still in experimental mode, but will
hopefully be production-usable soon. External contributions like allowing
constant variables for array lengths and improved error messages should make
your life as a programmer easier. Finally, the standard-json-io-system now
allows to select certain artifacts from a contract which should speed up your
code-compile-test-cycle even more!

**Features:**

- Code Generator: New ABI decoder which supports structs and arbitrarily nested
  arrays and checks input size (activate using
  `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;`).
- General: Allow constant variables to be used as array length.
- Inline Assembly: `if` statement.
- Standard JSON: Support the `outputSelection` field for selective compilation
  of target artifacts.
- Syntax Checker: Turn the usage of `callcode` into an error as experimental
  0.5.0 feature.
- Type Checker: Improve address checksum warning.
- Type Checker: More detailed errors for invalid array lengths (such as division
  by zero).

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
