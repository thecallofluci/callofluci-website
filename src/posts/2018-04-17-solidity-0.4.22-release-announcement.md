This release features several major and long-awaited changes:

- It is now possible to access dynamic data (arrays, strings, etc) returned by function calls.
- You can specify error reason strings for `revert` and `require` (support by tooling is still pending).
- We added the global functions `abi.encode()`, `abi.encodePacked()`, `abi.encodeWithSelector()` and `abi.encodeWithSignature()` which expose the ABI encoding functions and each return a `bytes` value.
- Constructors should now be defined using `constructor(uint arg1, uint arg2) { ... }` to make them stand out and avoid bugs when contracts are renamed but not their constructors.
- Some array operations got cheaper, especially the `push` function and initialization of memory arrays.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
