All remaining breaking changes planned for version 0.5.0 that can be implemented
in a backwards-compatible way made it into this release. Solidity can now detect
uninitialized storage pointers using control-flow analysis. It is again possible
to assign multiple return values from a function to newly declared variables and
the SMT checker is able to work with simple storage variables.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
