This is a major breaking release of the Solidity language and compiler that
includes many new safety features. In general, programmers have to be more
explicit, some weird edge-cases are removed from the language and the low-level
compiler interface is much simpler.

This release was long overdue and as a result has amassed an incredibly long
list of changes. Please refer to the
["Solidity v0.5.0 Breaking Changes‚Äù](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/050-breaking-changes.html)
section in the documentation about a good description of what has changed and
how to update your code, or if you are courageous, check out the
[changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.5.0/Changelog.md)!

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
