This release of the Solidity compiler includes several performance
optimizations. These include faster compilation time but also cheaper contracts
in some situations. This version also checks for all instances of uninitialized
storage references, has some improved error messages and other checks.

You can now create complete contracts in Yul through the support of the Yul
object format and the special functions `datasize`, `dataoffset` and `datacopy`.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
