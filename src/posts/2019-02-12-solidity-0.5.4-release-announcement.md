This release adds support for calldata structs and packed encoding with ABIEncoderV2. We also introduced some changes to the C API and added support for continuous fuzzing via Google oss-fuzz. In addition to that, we added a new commandline option for improved (colorized) diagnostics formatting.

**Language Features:**

- Allow calldata structs without dynamically encoded members with ABIEncoderV2.

**Compiler Features:**

- ABIEncoderV2: Implement packed encoding.
- C API (`libsolc` / raw `soljson.js`): Introduce `solidity_free` method which releases all internal buffers to save memory.
- Commandline Interface: Adds new option `new-reporter` for improved diagnostics formatting
  along with `color` and `no-color` for colorized output to be forced (or explicitly disabled).

**Bugfixes:**

- Code Generator: Defensively pad allocation of creationCode and runtimeCode to multiples of 32 bytes.
- Commandline Interface: Allow yul optimizer only for strict assembly.
- Parser: Disallow empty import statements.
- Type Checker: Disallow mappings with data locations other than `storage`.
- Type Checker: Fix internal error when a struct array index does not fit into a uint256.
- Type System: Properly report packed encoded size for arrays and structs (mostly unused until now).

**Build System:**

- Add support for continuous fuzzing via Google oss-fuzz
- SMT: If using Z3, require version 4.6.0 or newer.
- Soltest: Add parser that is used in the file-based unit test environment.
- Ubuntu PPA Packages: Use CVC4 as SMT solver instead of Z3

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
