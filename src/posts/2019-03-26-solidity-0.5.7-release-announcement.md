This release mainly fixes bugs in the optimizer and in the experimental ABI encoder. For details about the bug, please see the [official announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug/).

Furthermore, this release also allows you to use Yul as a language option (instead of "Solidity") in the [standard-json-interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.7/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description).

**Important Bugfixes:**

- ABIEncoderV2: Fix bugs related to loading short value types from storage when encoding an array or struct from storage.
- ABIEncoderV2: Fix buffer overflow problem when encoding packed array from storage.
- Optimizer: Fix wrong ordering of arguments in byte optimization rule for constants.

**Language Features:**

- Function calls with named arguments now work with overloaded functions.

**Compiler Features:**

- Inline Assembly: Issue error when using `callvalue()` inside nonpayable function (in the same way that `msg.value` already does).
- Standard JSON Interface: Support "Yul" as input language.
- SMTChecker: Show callstack together with model if applicable.
- SMTChecker: Support modifiers.
- Yul Optimizer: Enable stack allocation optimization by default if Yul optimizer is active (disable in `yulDetails`).

**Bugfixes:**

- Code Generator: Defensively pad memory for `type(Contract).name` to multiples of 32.
- Type System: Detect and disallow internal function pointers as parameters for public/external library functions, even when they are nested/wrapped in structs, arrays or other types.
- Yul Optimizer: Properly determine whether a variable can be eliminated during stack compression pass.
- Yul / Inline Assembly Parser: Disallow more than one case statement with the same label inside a switch based on the label's integer value.

**Build System:**

- Install scripts: Fix boost repository URL for CentOS 6.
- Soltest: Fix hex string update in soltest.
