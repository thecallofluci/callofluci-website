This release fixes a bug that was introduced in 0.5.14 (the previous release).
You are only affected if you manually enabled the Yul optimizer (not the regular
optimizer) and either used Yul stand-alone or via ABIEncoderV2. For more
details, please see buglist.json.

**Bugfixes:**

- Yul Optimizer: Fix incorrect redundant load optimization crossing user-defined
  functions that contain for-loops with memory / storage writes.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
