This release fixes a bug in the Yul optimizer related to `break` and `continue`
statements in loops. The Yul optimizer is part of the regular optimizer since
version 0.6.0. In version 0.5.x, you had to explicitly activate the Yul
optimizer in addition to the regular optimizer. The Yul optimizer only operates
on the code generated by ABIEncoderV2 or if you use it in a stand-alone way. The
code generated by ABIEncoderV2 does not make use of `break` and `continue`, but
these statements can be introduced by other optimizer steps. The Yul optimizer
currently is not run on inline-assembly code.

**Bugfixes:**

- Yul Optimizer: Fix bug in redundant assignment remover in combination with
  break and continue statements.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
