This release adds reason strings for compiler-generated reverts if you specify `revert-strings debug` or use the setting `settings.debug.revertStrings = "debug"`. Furthermore, contract types and enums are now allowed as keys for mappings and the doxygen-style comments are better supported by the AST.

**Language Features:**

- Allow contract types and enums as keys for mappings.
- Allow function selectors to be used as compile-time constants.

**Compiler Features:**

- AST: Add a new node for doxygen-style, structured documentation that can be received by contract, function, event and modifier definitions.
- Code Generator: Use `calldatacopy` instead of `codecopy` to zero out memory past input.
- Debug: Provide reason strings for compiler-generated internal reverts when using the `revert-strings` option or the `settings.debug.revertStrings` setting on `debug` mode.
- Structured Documentation: Report source locations for structured documentation errors.
- Yul Optimizer: Prune functions that call each other but are otherwise unreferenced.

**Bugfixes:**

- Assembly Output: Added missing `source` field to legacy assembly json output to complete the source reference.
- Parser: Fix an internal error for `abstract` without `contract`.
- Type Checker: Make invalid calls to uncallable types fatal errors instead of regular.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
