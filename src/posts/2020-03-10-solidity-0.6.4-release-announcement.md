Version 0.6.4 of Solidity fixes a bug that did not allow calling base contract
functions directly, another bug that caused issues with variable scoping in
try/catch and it allows for greater flexibility with regards to storage: It is
now possible to set storage slots for storage reference variables from inline
assembly. We expect this to allow new patterns in connection to delegatecall
proxies and upgradable contracts. Please be careful when using this feature!

**Language Features:**

- General: Deprecated `value(...)` and `gas(...)` in favor of `{value: ...}` and
  `{gas: ...}`
- Inline Assembly: Allow assigning to `_slot` of local storage variable
  pointers.
- Inline Assembly: Perform control flow analysis on inline assembly. Allows
  storage returns to be set in assembly only.

**Compiler Features:**

- AssemblyStack: Support for source locations (source mappings) and thus
  debugging Yul sources.
- Commandline Interface: Enable output of experimental optimized IR via
  `ir-optimized`.

**Bugfixes:**

- Inheritance: Fix incorrect error on calling unimplemented base functions.
- Reference Resolver: Fix scoping issue following try/catch statements.
- Standard-JSON-Interface: Fix a bug related to empty filenames and imports.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal errors when analysing tuples.
- Yul AST Import: correctly import blocks as statements, switch statements and
  string literals.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
