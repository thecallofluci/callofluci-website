[Solidity v0.6.7](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.6.7)
introduces support for EIP-165 via `type(InterfaceName).interfaceId`.

**Language Features:**

- Add support for EIP 165 interface identifiers with `type(I).interfaceId`.
- Allow virtual modifiers inside abstract contracts to have empty body.

**Compiler Features:**

- Optimizer: Simplify repeated AND and OR operations.
- Option to specify optimization steps to be performed by Yul optimizer with
  `yul-optimizations` in the commandline interface or
  `optimizer.details.yulDetails.optimizerSteps` in standard-json.
- Standard Json Input: Support the prefix `file://` in the field `urls`.

**Bugfixes:**

- SMTChecker: Fix internal error when fixed points are used.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using array slices.
- Type Checker: Disallow `virtual` and `override` for constructors.
- Type Checker: Fix several internal errors by performing size and recursiveness
  checks of types before the full type checking.
- Type Checker: Fix internal error when assigning to empty tuples.
- Type Checker: Fix internal error when applying unary operators to tuples with
  empty components.
- Type Checker: Perform recursiveness check on structs declared at the file
  level.

**Build System:**

- soltest.sh: `SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR` is no longer relative to `REPO_ROOT` to allow
  for build directories outside of the source tree.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
