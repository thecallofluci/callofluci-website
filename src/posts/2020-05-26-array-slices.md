Starting from
[version 0.6.0](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.6.0),
Solidity supports array slices.
[Array slices](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.8/types.html#array-slices)
are handy when you want to reference a contiguous portion of an array but do not
want to perform a full copy of that portion. For now, array slices are only
supported for calldata arrays.

## How to use Array Slices

The expression `x[start:end]` references a portion of the calldata array `x`
starting at index `start` and ending just before index `end`.

Both `start` and `end` are optional. If not provided, `start` defaults to `0`
and `end` defaults to the length of the respective array.

Please note that no copy from calldata to memory is performed.

You can use the slice syntax on variables, but also with `msg.data`.

Array slices can be especially useful in combination with `abi.decode` in the
[fallback function](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/03/26/fallback-receive-split/):

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.5;

interface OtherContract {
    function changeOwner(address) external;
}

contract Proxy {
    OtherContract implementation;
    address badOwner;
    fallback() external {
        if (msg.sig == OtherContract.changeOwner.selector) {
            // Here, abi.decode directly operates on the calldata array slice.
            address newOwner = abi.decode(msg.data[4:], (address));
            require(newOwner != badOwner);
        }
        (bool success,) = address(implementation).delegatecall(msg.data);
        require(success);
    }
}
```

## How Array Slices Work Internally

Calldata arrays have always been represented by two values: A start pointer and
a length value. This is exactly the same representation we use for calldata
array slices.

## Limitations and Future Plans

Array slices support index access and `.length` just like arrays, but do not
support most copy operations.

As of now, array slices are only implemented for calldata.
