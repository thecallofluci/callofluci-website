[Solidity v0.6.11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.6.11)
adds inheritance to NatSpec comments, improves debugging data output and fixes
some minor issues with opening up `calldata` for non-external functions.

## Notable New Features

### NatSpec Inheritance and on Events

NatSpec comments are a way to describe the behaviour of a function to end-users.
It also allows to provide more detailed information to developers.

One regular use-case is that you document the behaviour of an interface and then
implement the interface in a derived contract. Previously, you had to repeat the
documentation in the derived contract. This is now obsolete: The compiler will
automatically inherit the documentation of the base function if the derived
function does not provide any NatSpec tag.

If you provide any of the tags (`@param`, `@dev`, ...), then nothing will be
inherited. The next release will provide a feature to explicitly inherit from a
certain base also in that case, so stay tuned!

Furhermore, NatSpec is now supported on events.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.11;
interface Gathering {
  /// The address `participant` just registered for the gathering.
  event Registered(address participant);

  /// Registers `msg.sender` to take part in the gathering.
  function register() external;
}

contract MyGathering is Gathering {
  mapping(address => bool) public participants;

  function register() public override {
    participants[msg.sender] = true;
    emit Registered(msg.sender);
  }
}
```

The derived contract `MyGathering` in the example code above will produce the
following userdoc:

```json
{
  "events": {
    "Registered(address)": {
      "notice": "The address `participant` just registered for the gathering."
    }
  },
  "kind": "user",
  "methods": {
    "register()": {
      "notice": "Registers `msg.sender` to take part in the gathering."
    }
  },
  "version": 1
}
```

### Unit Denomination `gwei`

You can now use `gwei` as a unit denomination alongside `wei`, `szabo`, `finney`
and `ether`:

```solidity
reqire(msg.value >= 10 gwei);
```

## Full Changelog

### Language Features:

- General: Add unit denomination `gwei`
- Yul: Support `linkersymbol` builtin in standalone assembly mode to refer to
  library addresses.
- Yul: Support using string literals exceeding 32 bytes as literal arguments for
  builtins.

### Compiler Features:

- NatSpec: Add fields `kind` and `version` to the JSON output.
- NatSpec: Inherit tags from unique base functions if derived function does not
  provide any.
- Commandline Interface: Prevent some incompatible commandline options from
  being used together.
- NatSpec: Support NatSpec comments on events.
- Yul Optimizer: Store knowledge about storage / memory after `a := sload(x)` /
  `a := mload(x)`.
- SMTChecker: Support external calls to unknown code.
- Source Maps: Also tag jumps into and out of Yul functions as jumps into and
  out of functions.

### Bugfixes:

- NatSpec: Do not consider `////` and `/***` as NatSpec comments.
- Type Checker: Disallow constructor parameters with `calldata` data location.
- Type Checker: Do not disallow assigning to calldata variables.
- Type Checker: Fix internal error related to `using for` applied to
  non-libraries.
- Wasm backend: Fix code generation for for-loops with pre statements.
- Wasm backend: Properly support both `i32.drop` and `i64.drop`, and remove
  `drop`.
- Yul: Disallow the same variable to occur multiple times on the left-hand side
  of an assignment.
- Yul: Fix source location of variable multi-assignment.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
