[Solidity v0.6.12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.6.12) adds more flexibility
when using inheritance with NatSpec comments and introduces many small improvements to the optimizer.

## Notable New Features

### NatSpec Inheritance

As explained in the [Solidity 0.6.11 release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/07/07/solidity-0611-release-announcement/),
NatSpec comments are now inherited automatically if you do not provide any
NatSpec in the derived function. Starting from Solidity 0.6.12, you can
explicitly inherit comments from a base contract using the tag `@inheritdoc`
even if you specify some of the tags.
The tags that are not given will then be taken from the specified base class'
function.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.11;
interface Gathering {
  /// The address `participant` just registered for the gathering.
  event Registered(address participant);

  /// Registers `msg.sender` to take part in the gathering.
  /// @param name The name of the participant.
  function register(string calldata name) external;
}

contract MyGathering is Gathering {
  mapping(address => string) public participants;
  uint public participantCount;

  /// Registers `msg.sender` to take part in the gathering
  /// unless there are already more than 10 participants.
  /// @inheritdoc Gathering
  function register(string calldata name) public override {
    require(participantCount <= 10);
    participants[msg.sender] = name;
    participantCount++;
    emit Registered(msg.sender);
  }
}
```

The derived contract `MyGathering` in the example code above will have
the documentation for the parameter "name" as part of its developer documentation.

## Full Changelog

### Language Features:

- NatSpec: Implement tag `@inheritdoc` to copy documentation from a specific base contract.
- Wasm backend: Add `i32.ctz`, `i64.ctz`, `i32.popcnt`, and `i64.popcnt`.

### Compiler Features:

- Code Generator: Avoid double cleanup when copying to memory.
- Code Generator: Evaluate `keccak256` of string literals at compile-time.
- Optimizer: Add rule to remove shifts inside the byte opcode.
- Peephole Optimizer: Add rule to remove swap after dup.
- Peephole Optimizer: Remove unnecessary masking of tags.
- Yul EVM Code Transform: Free stack slots directly after visiting the right-hand-side of variable declarations instead of at the end of the statement only.

### Bugfixes:

- SMTChecker: Fix error in events with indices of type static array.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error in sequential storage array pushes (`push().push()`).
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using bitwise operators on fixed bytes type.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using compound bitwise operator assignments on array indices inside branches.
- Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error related to oversized types.
- Type Checker: Fix overload resolution in combination with `{value: ...}`.

### Build System:

- Update internal dependency of jsoncpp to 1.9.3.
