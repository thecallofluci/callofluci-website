[Solidity v0.7.3](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.7.3)
fixes a bug in the dynamic-array cleanup. To learn more about the bug and check
if your contract is vulnerable please read this
[post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/10/07/solidity-dynamic-array-cleanup-bug)
with further details about the bug. Additionally, v0.7.3 adds the option to stop
compilation after the parsing stage using `solc --stop-after parsing`.

## Important Bugfixes

- Code Generator: Properly cleanup after copying dynamic-array to storage for
  packed types. Read more
  [here](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/10/07/solidity-dynamic-array-cleanup-bug).

## Notable New Features

### Stop Compilation after Parsing

`solc --stop-after parsing` (or `settings.stopAfter = 'parsing'` in
standard-json) can now be used to instruct the compiler to do as little analysis
on the code as possible. It will not even try to load imported (but not
specified) files. This can be used to do a quick external analysis on the
abstract syntax tree, like building an import hierarchy.

In the future, we might introduce more stages to stop compilation at, but for
now, only the first stage "parsing" is supported.

## Full Changelog

### Compiler Features:

- Code generator: Implemented events with function type as one of its indexed
  parameters.
- General: Option to stop compilation after parsing stage. Can be used with
  `solc --stop-after parsing`
- Optimizer: Optimize `exp` when base is `-1`.
- SMTChecker: Support `addmod` and `mulmod`.
- SMTChecker: Support array slices.
- SMTChecker: Support type conversions.

### Bugfixes:

- Code Generator: Properly cleanup after copying dynamic-array to storage for
  packed types. Read more
  [here](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/10/07/solidity-dynamic-array-cleanup-bug).
- Fixed internal compiler errors for certain contracts involving the `new`
  expression.
- JSON AST: Fix internal error when using `--ast-json` on a function with memory
  arguments in ABIEncoderV2 contracts.
- Type Checker: Add missing checks for calls using types incompatible with
  ABIEncoderV1 in modules where ABIEncoderV2 is not enabled.
- Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error when calling `.push(<arg>)` for a
  storage array with a nested mapping.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
