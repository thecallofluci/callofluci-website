title: 'Solidity Dynamic Array Cleanup Bug'

On September 17, 2020, a bug in the Solidity code generator was found. The bug
is fixed with
[version 0.7.3](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.7.3)
released on October 7, 2020. **The bug is present in all prior versions of
Solidity.**

We assigned the bug a severity level of "medium".

## Technical Details of the Bug

**Summary**: For a dynamically-sized storage-array with types of size at most 16
bytes, assignments that require deleting slots did not zero out the deleted
slots properly.

Consider a dynamically-sized array in storage whose base-type is small enough
such that multiple values can be packed into a single slot, such as `uint128[]`.
Let us define its length to be `l`. When this array gets assigned from another
array with a smaller length, say `m`, the slots between elements `m` and `l`
have to be cleaned by zeroing them out. However, this cleaning was not performed
properly. Specifically, after the slot corresponding to `m`, only the first
packed value was cleaned up. If this array gets resized to a length larger than
`m`, the indices corresponding to the unclean parts of the slot contained the
original value, instead of 0. The resizing here is performed by assigning to the
array `length`, by a `push()` or via inline assembly.

An example of the bug is the following:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
// The bug is present in all versions of solidity prior to 0.7.3
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.7.3;
contract C {
    uint128[] x;
    function f() public {
        x.push(42); x.push(42); x.push(42); x.push(42);
        uint128[] memory y = new uint128[](1);
        y[0] = 23;
        // This will shrink the array x to one element.
        x = y;
        // Resizing the array to length 4.
        x.push(); x.push(); x.push();
        // After resizing the array, its contents are [23, 0, 0, 42],
        // instead of [23, 0, 0, 0]. Resizing can be also be done by
        // assigning to `.length` or by assigning to the `slot` member
        // inside inline assembly.
    }
}
```

## How to check if contract is vulnerable

If your contract does all of the following, try to run tests to see if your
contract was relying on having elements in the resized part to be zero.

1. The contract has a dynamically-sized array in storage whose base-type is of
   size at most 16 bytes.
2. You perform an assignment to the aforementioned array by another array of
   smaller length (from either memory, storage or calldata).
3. You increase the length of the aforementioned array without assigning a value
   to the new elements.
4. You read from one of the new elements before assigning a new value.

Your contracts are not affected if you are only using `.push(<arg>)` or if you
assign a value (even zero) to the new elements after increasing the length of
the array.
