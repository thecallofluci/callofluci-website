[Solidity v0.7.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.7.4) fixes a storage corruption bug of medium severity.
To learn more about the bug and to check if your contract is vulnerable please read this [post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/10/19/empty-byte-array-copy-bug) with further details about the bug. The bug has been reported by John Toman of the Certora development team.

Additionally, v0.7.4 adds constants at file-level.

## Important Bugfixes

- Code Generator: Fix data corruption bug when copying empty byte arrays from memory or calldata to storage. Read more [here](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/10/19/empty-byte-array-copy-bug).

## Notable New Features

### Constants at File-Level

In order to make functions at file-level more useful, Solidity now also allows to
define constant variables at file-level:

```solidity
uint constant EXPONENT = 10;
uint constant MULTIPLIER = 2**EXPONENT;

struct Fixed { uint value; }

function toFixed(uint x) pure returns (Fixed memory ret) {
    ret.value = x * MULTIPLIER;
}
```

Such constants have to follow the same rules as constants at contract-level.
This means, for example, the value has to be fixed at compile-time and only
some types are supported.

You can import constants from other source files like you import any other identifier:

`import {MyConstant, MyStruct} from "myHelper.sol";`

## Full Changelog

### Language Features:

- Constants can be defined at file level.

### Compiler Features:

- Command Line Interface: New option `--model-checker-engine` allows to choose a specific SMTChecker engine. Options are `all` (default), `bmc`, `chc` and `none`.
- Control Flow Graph: Print warning for non-empty functions with unnamed return parameters that are not assigned a value in all code paths.
- SMTChecker: Support `keccak256`, `sha256`, `ripemd160` and `ecrecover` in the CHC engine.
- SMTChecker: Support inline arrays.
- SMTChecker: Support variables `block`, `msg` and `tx` in the CHC engine.
- Standard JSON: New option `modelCheckerSettings.engine` allows to choose a specific SMTChecker engine. Options are `all` (default), `bmc`, `chc` and `none`.

### Bugfixes:

- Code generator: Fix `ABIEncoderV2` pragma from the current module affecting inherited functions and applied modifiers.
- Code generator: Fix internal compiler error when referencing members via module name but not using the reference.
- Code generator: Fix internal error on returning structs containing mappings from library function.
- Code generator: Use revert instead of invalid opcode for out-of-bounds array index access in getter.
- Contract Level Checker: Add missing check against inheriting functions with ABIEncoderV2 return types in ABIEncoderV1 contracts.
- Name Resolver: Fix shadowing/same-name warnings for later declarations.
- Type Checker: Allow arrays of contract types as type expressions and as arguments for `abi.decode`.
- Type Checker: Disallow invalid use of library names as type name.
- Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error caused by storage parameters with nested mappings in libraries.
