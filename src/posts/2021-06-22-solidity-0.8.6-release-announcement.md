[Solidity v0.8.6](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.6) fixes some
non-critical but annoying bugs, especially a warning about unreachable code that
is in fact reachable.

## Bugfixes

### Unreachable Warning

With Solidity 0.8.5, we released a new feature that detects if code is unreachable
because a called function always reverts before the code is executed. This detection contained a bug
in connection with nested calls to internal library functions where the "reverting behaviour"
of a function was not properly updated after a
function called by it was determined to be not always reverting.

Because the bug was rather common, we are releasing this version with an unusually
short changelog.

### Optimizer Setting

We discovered that the default optimizer setting differed depending on the way
the compiler was invoked: Using the compiler on the commandline ("`solc`")
caused minimal optimizer features to be activated (the intended functionality)
while using `solc-js` all optimizer features were disabled.

These minimal features are the "peephole optimizer", a routine that performs
obvious replacements like removing `PUSH1 0 POP` and the "jumpdest remover"
which removes code that is not jumped to from anywhere.

The peephole optimizer and the jumpdest remover are activated even when
setting `settings.optimizer.enabled` to `false` in Standard JSON
and have to be explicitly disabled in the detailed settings.

The bug was that providing a value for `settings.optimizer` but not including
`enabled` in it was not equivalent to setting `enabled` to `false`.
It was equivalent to explicitly disabling all optimizer components.
If `settings.optimizer` was not provided at all, the bug did not manifest.

## Full Changelog

### Language Features

- Yul: Special meaning of `".metadata"` data object in Yul object.

### Bugfixes

- Control Flow Graph: Fix incorrectly reported unreachable code.
- Solc-Js: When running `solcjs` without the `--optimize` flag, use `settings.optimizer.enabled=false` in Standard JSON instead of omitting the key.
- Standard JSON: Omitting `settings.optimizer.enabled` was not equivalent to setting it to `false`. It meant disabling also the peephole optimizer and jumpdest remover which by default still run with `enabled=false`.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
