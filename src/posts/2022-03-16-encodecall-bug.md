title: 'abi.encodeCall Literals Bug'

On March 10th, 2022, the Solidity team discovered a bug in the implementation of
`abi.encodeCall` when used together with fixed-length bytes literals.

It was introduced together with `abi.encodeCall` in Solidity 0.8.11 and is fixed
in 0.8.13.

We assigned the bug a severity of "very low".

## Which Contracts are Affected?

You might be affected if you use `abi.encodeCall(f, (...))` where `f` takes a
`bytesNN` parameter and you provide the value for that parameter either as a hex
literal (`0x1234` or `hex"abcd"`) or as a string literal (`"abcd"`).

If you only pass variables to `abi.encodeCall`, your code is not affected.

## Technical Details

The compiler did check that the types of the values are all implicitly
convertible to the types of the parameters of the function (this was the main
advantage of `abi.encodeCall` over `abi.encode` and the reason for adding the
feature), but it did not take the types properly into account when generating
the code for this function call. The generated code was still the same as the
one for `abi.encode`, which just encodes according to the types of the
arguments.

The problem is that literals like `0x1234` and `"abcd"` can be implicitly
converted to different types: The first can be converted to both `bytes2` and
`uint16` and the second can be converted to `bytes4` and `bytes memory`.

In the first case, the compiler chose to encode `0x1234` as a `uint16`. This
means it right-aligned it instead of left-aligning it for `bytes2`. In the
second case, it was encoded as `bytes memory`, which is a dynamic type, and thus
at the place of the `bytes4` value, an offset pointer was stored and additional
data was added at the end.

Since the bug is only present for literals (actual variables have proper types
and implicit conversions are always no-ops), it should be easy to detect with
simple testing.
