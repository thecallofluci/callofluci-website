title: 'Bug Concerning Data Location during Inheritance'

On February 5th 2021, Nicolas Venturo reported a bug that allows overriding
functions to change the data location of parameters from `memory` to `calldata`.

The bug was introduced in Solidity 0.6.9 together with the ability to use
`calldata` data location for all variables (and not just parameters of external
functions).

We assigned the bug a severity of "very low".

## Which Contracts are Affected?

The effect of the bug is that a memory pointer is interpreted as a calldata
pointer or vice-versa. It can only happen if you change the data location of a
function during inheritance and perform an internal call at a location that is
only aware of the original function signature from the base contract.

One case is that you have a base contract where you perform an internal call to
a virtual function of the same base contract and there is a derived contract
that overrides the base contract's function and changes the data location.

```solidity
abstract contract I {
    // The base contract uses "calldata"
    function f(uint[] calldata x) virtual internal;
}
contract C is I {
    // The derived contract uses "memory" and the compiler
    // does not complain - this is the bug in the compiler.
    function f(uint[] memory x)  override internal {
        // If you use `x`, it will access memory
        // even if `D.g` passed us a calldata pointer.
        // This leads to the wrong data being accessed.
    }
}
abstract contract D is I {
    function g(uint[] calldata x)  external {
        // Since D only "knows" `I`, the signature of `f`
        // uses calldata, while the virtual lookup ends
        // up with `C.f`, which uses memory. This results
        // in the calldata pointer `x` being passed and
        // interpreted as a memory pointer.
        f(x);
    }
}
contract X is C, D { }
```

In the example above, the bug will only manifest itself in `X`, which combines
the faulty override in `C` with the virtual function call in `D`.

It is likely that any test covering the affected function call will be able to
detect the problem.

External calls are not affected, and it is actually not a problem to change the
data location between `calldata` and `memory` for `external` functions. This is
also how the bug was introduced: The compiler did not distinguish between
`calldata` and `memory` in inheritance because it does not matter for `external`
functions and `calldata` was only allowed inside `external` functions.
