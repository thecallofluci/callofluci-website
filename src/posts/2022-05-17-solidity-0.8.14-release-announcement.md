[Solidity v0.8.14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.14)
fixes two important bugs.

The first one is related to ABI-encoding nested arrays directly from calldata.
You can find more information in the
[blog post](/2022/05/17/calldata-reencode-size-check-bug/).

The second bug is triggered in certain inheritance structures and can cause a
memory pointer to be interpreted as a calldata pointer or vice-versa. We also
have a dedicated [blog post](/2022/05/17/data-location-inheritance-bug/) about
this bug.

Apart from these, there are several minor bug fixes and improvements.

_Please note: Unfortunately, the npm wrapper package of this version is
corrupted. Using the new `soljson.js` with solc-js 0.8.13 will work, but the
0.8.14 npm release (now marked as deprecated) is missing a file and due to that
does not work properly. We released
[0.8.14-fixed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc/v/0.8.14-fixed) in case you
need a working npm package as dependency. Note however, that npm will not pick
it up automatically._

## Full Changelog

Important Bugfixes:

- ABI Encoder: When ABI-encoding values from calldata that contain nested
  arrays, correctly validate the nested array length against `calldatasize()` in
  all cases.
- Override Checker: Allow changing data location for parameters only when
  overriding external functions.

Compiler Features:

- Assembly-Json Exporter: Include source list in `sourceList` field.
- Commandline Interface: Option `--pretty-json` works also with the following
  options: `--abi`, `--asm-json`, `--ast-compact-json`, `--devdoc`,
  `--storage-layout`, `--userdoc`.
- Language Server: Allow full filesystem access to language server.
- Peephole Optimizer: Remove operations without side effects before simple
  terminations.
- SMTChecker: Support `abi.encodeCall` taking into account the called selector.

Bugfixes:

- Assembly-Json Exporter: Fix assembly json export to store jump types of
  operations in `jumpType` field instead of `value`.
- SMTChecker: Fix ABI compatibility with z3 >=4.8.16.
- SMTChecker: Fix bug when z3 is selected but not available at runtime.
- Type Checker: Properly check restrictions of `using ... global` in conjunction
  with libraries.
- TypeChecker: Convert parameters of function type to how they would be called
  for `abi.encodeCall`.

A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
