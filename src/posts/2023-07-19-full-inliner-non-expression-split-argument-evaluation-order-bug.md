On July 4, 2023, Robert Chen from OtterSec discovered a bug in the Yul
optimizer.

The earliest affected version of the compiler is 0.6.7, which introduced the
ability to modify the optimizer step sequence.
[Solidity version 0.8.21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.21),
released on July 19, 2023, provides a fix.

We assigned the bug an overall score of "low". The bug has "high" severity in
affected cases, but we deem the likelihood of it actually affecting deployed
contracts as "very low".

## Which Contracts are Affected?

The prerequisite to trigger the bug is to meet **all** of the following
conditions:

1. The use of
   [Yul optimizer](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#yul-based-optimizer-module).
2. The use of a custom optimizer step sequence.
3. Presence of the
   [`FullInliner` step](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#full-inliner)
   (`i`) in the sequence.
4. Code in non-expression-split form being able to reach the `FullInliner` step.

   It is not generally possible for the user to precisely control whether the
   code coming out of the code generator is or is not in this form. However, it
   is guaranteed that the code passed through the
   [`ExpressionSplitter` step](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#expression-splitter)
   (`x`) is expression-split, and the opposite is true for code that is run
   through the
   [`ExpressionJoiner` step](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#expression-joiner)
   (`j`). Therefore sequences where `i` is always preceded by `x` with no
   intervening occurrences of `j` are safe. Other sequences may or may not be
   affected depending on their exact structure.

Lack of user-provided Yul code (in the form of inline assembly or pure Yul
input) significantly decreases the chances of triggering the bug.

The bug affects both the legacy and the IR-based compilation pipeline. This is
primarily due to the fact that inline assembly is passed through the Yul
optimizer regardless of which pipeline is used. Also, certain language features
are compiled from internal Yul code, even by the legacy code generator.

## Technical Details

The immediate cause of the buggy behavior is the fact that `FullInliner` does
not preserve the evaluation order of arguments in function calls it inlines.
When the arguments are themselves function calls with side effects, a change in
the order may alter the results of contract execution.

The evaluation order was initially assumed not to pose any problems since
function calls where it matters should never have been subject to inlining. The
step was designed to follow `ExpressionSplitter`, which converts the code into
the expression-split form, where all call arguments are simple identifiers. Any
non-expression-split call appearing in the input was supposed to be ignored,
which was not actually the case as it turned out.

Despite these flaws, the problem did not affect the compiler in practice because
the default optimizer sequence was carefully chosen to always run
`ExpressionSplitter` before `FullInliner`. However, the later introduction of a
mechanism that allowed users to supply a custom sequence made it possible to
trigger the bug.

### Optimizer Step Sequence

Yul optimizer works by refining the unoptimized IR produced by the code
generator in
[discrete steps](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#optimizer-steps),
each one receiving the output of the previous one. The order of steps is
determined by the step sequence.

Initially, the sequence was hard-coded in compiler's source code. Version 0.6.7
introduced options that allow the user to
[customize the steps to be executed and their order](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#selecting-optimizations).
This is done via `settings.optimizer.details.yulDetails.optimizerSteps` in
Standard JSON or `--yul-optimizations` on the CLI.

Choosing a good sequence is a challenging task. It requires awareness of both
how individual steps work and which other steps transform the code in ways that
are beneficial or detrimental to their operation. For example, many steps
benefit from code being in the
[SSA form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form). The
[`SSATransform` step](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#ssa-transform)
(`a`) provides that form, but also introduces redundant assignments, which is
why it is usually combined with
[`RedundantAssignEliminator`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#redundant-assign-eliminator)
(`r`).
[`ConditionalSimplifier`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#conditional-simplifier)
is a step that works best when the code is in the SSA form, but it destroys this
property, which can affect the effectiveness of steps executed later in the
sequence.

The
[default sequence](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.21/libsolidity/interface/OptimiserSettings.h#L44-L62)
was carefully chosen and refined over time to provide well-optimized code. While
it still has room for improvement (especially in terms of performance), it
ensures that prerequisites of all steps are met.

### Argument Evaluation Order in Yul

In Yul, the order in which function arguments are evaluated is always right to
left. For example:

```yul
f(add(mload(0), mload(x)), mload(1))
```

The expression above would be evaluated in the following order:

- `mload(1)`
- `mload(x)`
- `mload(0)`
- `add(...)`
- `f(...)`

Note that the order does not matter when the expressions have no side effects.
Even if `mload(0)` was evaluated before `mload(x)`, the behavior of this code
fragment would not change.

However, the introduction of expressions with side effects changes this:

```yul
function store(x, y) -> r {
    sstore(x, y)
    r := y
}

add(sload(0), store(0, k))
```

Evaluating `store()` after `sload()` in the code above would change the result.

### Expression-Split Form

The job of the expression splitter is to transform the code into a simpler form
that is easier for some other optimizer steps to work with and not affected by
the choice of evaluation order. This transformation involves evaluating call
arguments first and storing the results in new variables. Then those variables
are passed to the call instead.

For example:

```yul
add(sload(0), store(0, k))
```

Would be transformed into:

```yul
let _a := k
let _b := 0
let _x := store(_b, _a)
let _c := 0
let _y := sload(_c)
let _z := add(_y, _x)
```

Note that in the transformed code, there is no ambiguity as to the order of side
effects and evaluating function arguments in a different order would not affect
it.

### `FullInliner` and Inlining of Function Calls

`FullInliner` uses heuristics to determine which function calls would be better
off replaced by instructions from the function body, and performs the
replacement. By itself, this makes the code less optimal in most cases, because
it increases the code size and does not have a significant effect on the cost of
execution. However, the benefit of this step is that it enables other steps
(which usually do not work across function boundaries) to better optimize the
resulting code.

When inlining a function, the inliner needs to ensure that its arguments will be
evaluated the same way as in the call. This involves replacing them with local
variables at the point of inlining, and renaming them to avoid clashes with
identifiers used in the surrounding code.

Yul has three kinds of expressions that can be used as call arguments:

- Literals (e.g. `0x42` or `0`)
- Identifiers (e.g. `k` or `ret`)
- Function calls (e.g. `f(x)` or `sstore(0, sload(x))`)

Let's consider a function `f()` defined as follows:

```yul
function f(a, b) -> r {
    let c := mul(a, 4)
    let r := add(c, b)
}
```

When called with a literal or an identifier, inlining is straightforward:

```yul
let k := 0x42
f(24, k)
```

The call can be simply replaced with the body of the function as long as we take
care to rename variables to avoid name clashes:

```yul
let k := 0x42
let _q := 24
let _p := k
let _c := mul(_q, 4)
let _r := add(_c, _p)
```

Introducing function calls as arguments, however, requires paying more attention
to the evaluation order. Let's now consider two functions with side effects:

```yul
function rev() -> r { revert(0, 0) }
function ret() -> r { return(0, 0) }
```

In the call below, the evaluation order determines whether the transaction will
revert or terminate successfully. In this case it should revert:

```yul
f(ret(), rev())
```

When faced with code like this, `FullInliner` was supposed to refrain from
inlining. This would not decrease the effectiveness of the optimizer under
normal circumstances because the inliner was meant to be paired with
`ExpressionSplitter`, which ensures that arguments are always simple
identifiers.

As a result of the bug, `FullInliner` would inline such a call regardless, doing
it as if the arguments were identifiers, and putting the argument expressions in
an order different from the usual Yul evaluation order:

```yul
_q := ret()
_p := rev()
let _c := mul(_q, 4)
let _r := add(_c, _p)
```

The inlined code above would now (incorrectly) terminate successfully instead of
reverting.

## Effects of the Bug

The bug has the potential to alter the behavior of a contract in a very
significant way. Reordering reverts or returns may lead to storage writes,
memory writes, or event emissions not being performed. It may also lead to the
contract not reverting (and therefore not rolling back some operations) when it
should or vice-versa.

It is important to note that high-level Solidity code is unlikely to be affected
unless the used optimizer sequence explicitly includes a step that actively
transforms the code into the non-expression-split form (i.e. `ExpressionJoiner`)
before `FullInliner`.

In the absence of this, triggering the bug would likely require inline assembly
or a contract written in pure Yul. This is because nested function calls in
Solidity code are not directly transformed to nested calls in generated Yul. The
code generated by the IR pipeline is mainly in the expression-split form, where
each expression is assigned to a separate variable because code in this form is
very easy to generate. The compiler does generate calls in the
non-expression-split form in its own helper functions, but these rarely have
side effects other than simple reverts.

## Impact

The complex set of conditions required to trigger the bug makes it unlikely to
occur in actually deployed contracts.

The use of custom optimizer sequences in the first place is uncommon. The
feature is intentionally not widely advertised. Using it in a way that provides
actual benefits is not easy. Anyone with enough knowledge to use it would also
be likely to avoid inefficient sequences necessary to trigger this bug.

Moreover, the bug will not affect the vast majority of Solidity code. The code
most likely to be broken by it is inline assembly, which usually constitutes a
small portion of the whole contract. The code also has to actually contain
nested function calls with side effects.

Therefore, while the bug can have severe consequences, the overall impact on
real projects is low.
