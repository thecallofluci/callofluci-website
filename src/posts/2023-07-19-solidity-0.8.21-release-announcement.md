We are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler,
[Solidity v0.8.21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.21).

## Notable New Features

### Stack-to-memory mover always enabled via-IR

The release addresses the issue of unoptimized code produced by the IR-based
code generation pipeline being overly prone to "Stack Too Deep" errors. This is
meant to help tools such as debuggers, which lose much of their effectiveness
when working with optimized code.

The legacy pipeline can often avoid running out of reachable stack slots even in
unoptimized mode, but this comes at the cost of higher complexity since many
optimizations are hard-coded as a part of code generation. The new pipeline was
designed from the beginning with the goal of separating these two concerns. It
produces straightforward but very inefficient output that is meant to be refined
in discrete steps by the Yul optimizer. The transformation performed by each
step can be verified and reasoned about in isolation. The downside of this
approach is that unoptimized code very often has lots of unused local variables
and runs into stack issues.

Our solution is to pass the unoptimized code through minimal transformations
that help with stack issues but do not change it significantly as full
optimization would. Specifically, the compiler will now run
[`UnusedPruner`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#unused-pruner)
optimizer step on such code to remove unused variables. In addition, the
stack-to-memory mover mechanism is now always enabled, resolving remaining stack
issues, though at the cost of extra memory accesses.

Both of these things were already possible to achieve through existing optimizer
settings but were not a part of the default behavior. Despite technically
involving the optimizer module, we consider them an essential part of the new
pipeline and the new baseline for what unoptimized code means.

## Important Bugfixes

- Code Generator: Always generate code for the expression in
  `<expression>.selector` in the legacy code generation pipeline. You can read
  more about it in our blog post
  [here](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/07/19/missing-side-effects-on-selector-access-bug).
- Yul Optimizer: Fix `FullInliner` step (`i`) not preserving the evaluation
  order of arguments passed into inlined functions in code that is not in
  expression-split form (i.e. when using a custom optimizer sequence in which
  the step not preceded by `ExpressionSplitter` (`x`)). You can read more about
  it in our blog post
  [here](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/07/19/full-inliner-non-expression-split-argument-evaluation-order-bug).

## Language Features

- Allow qualified access to events from other contracts.
- Relax restrictions on initialization of immutable variables. Reads and writes
  may now happen at any point at construction time outside of functions and
  modifiers. Explicit initialization is no longer mandatory.

### Qualified access to foreign events

Solidity 0.8.21 enables access to events defined in contracts and interfaces
that the current contract does not inherit from. As a result, the following
example will now compile without errors:

```solidity
library   L { event EL(); }
interface I { event EI(); }
contract  C { event EC(); }
contract  D { event ED(); }

contract E is D {
    event EE();

    function foo() public {
        emit L.EL();
        emit I.EI(); // Not allowed on 0.8.20
        emit C.EC(); // Not allowed on 0.8.20
        emit ED();
        emit EE();
    }
}
```

This used to be disallowed due to limitations of the NatSpec JSON format, which
is a part of contract metadata. The format identifies events by their
signatures, which include only unqualified names, and allows only one piece of
NatSpec to be specified. Since event definitions with the same signature defined
in different contracts represent the same event in the ABI, the correct solution
is to include NatSpec associated with all available definitions, but such a
change is not backward-compatible and has to wait for a breaking release.

In the meantime, this restriction was enough of a usability problem for language
users that we decided to side-step it by arbitrarily ignoring NatSpec of one of
the events. In case of a conflict, NatSpec of the definition present in the
current contract or another contract in its inheritance hierarchy takes
precedence. This will be corrected with the introduction of NatSpec v2.

### Relaxed restrictions on initialization of immutable variables

Given the several bugs that were found in the past few months where our checks
for immutable initialization were not up to par, and thus allowed several edge
cases where said immutables could remain uninitialized (e.g., branches of
`try/catch` blocks, `for` loops, etc.), we have decided to relax restrictions on
the initialization of immutables significantly.

Whilst immutables can still only be explicitly initialized at construction time,
this initialization is now optional, as all immutables will be default (zero)
initialized regardless. We have also decided to lift the _assign once_
restriction, which means you may now assign to an immutable more than once, with
the last assignment being retained.

A significant downside of the mechanism responsible for enforcing these
restrictions was that, out of necessity, it prevented some patterns of
initialization that were perfectly safe but hard to verify. In a general case,
precisely determining whether a variable is initialized on all possible paths
through the construction code is not possible without false positives. To deal
with this problem, the mechanism used simply disallowed initialization inside
functions, modifiers, conditionals, loops and `try`/`catch` blocks. Now the
restrictions on the latter three have been removed, and we hope to drop
restrictions on initialization inside functions and modifiers as well,
eventually.

The example below shows some of the ways to initialize immutables that are now
possible.

```solidity
contract C {
    uint immutable x;
    uint immutable y;
    uint immutable z; // Not initialized. Will be 0

    constructor(bool condition, uint value) {
        x = value;
        if (condition) {
            x = 42; // Overwriting already assigned value
            z = 42;
        }
        else
            z = 24; // On 0.8.20 initialization inside an if is not allowed
                    // even if there's no way for z to remain uninitialized
    }
}
```

It is important to note that we are relaxing these restrictions because the
checks were ultimately artificially imposing _deployed_ contract immutability
restrictions on contract creation for consistency and not for security reasons.
Not all of the patterns that this enables are necessarily recommended, but the
decision of whether they should be used is now in the hands of users.

## Bug affecting the reproducibility of unoptimized bytecode from the IR pipeline

The release fixes a minor bug in the IR-based code generator, which resulted in
different (but functionally equivalent) bytecode being produced depending on how
the compiler binary was built. In particular, binaries built using the Clang C++
compiler would, in certain situations, order Yul functions differently than ones
built with GCC. The case that triggers the bug is the indexing of memory arrays.
This results in multiple Yul helpers being generated, their order dependent on
the C++ compiler used.

The bug affected only unoptimized code generated by the IR pipeline, i.e.
required the use of `settings.viaIR` in Standard JSON or the `--via-ir` flag on
the CLI. The use of the Yul optimizer nullifies its effects since it reorders
the functions.

The bug affects the official binaries provided in
[solc-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/). The emscripten and macOS
binaries are built with Clang, Linux binaries with GCC, and Windows ones with
MSVC. It is recommended that tools performing source verification of contracts
consider the possibility of the deployed contract being produced by either of
these binaries.

## Full Changelog

### Compiler Features

- Commandline Interface: Add `--ast-compact-json` output in assembler mode.
- Commandline Interface: Add `--ir-ast-json` and `--ir-optimized-ast-json`
  outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and
  optimized IR.
- Commandline Interface: Respect `--optimize-yul` and `--no-optimize-yul` in
  compiler mode and accept them in assembler mode as well.
  `--optimize --no-optimize-yul` combination now allows enabling EVM assembly
  optimizer without enabling Yul optimizer.
- EWasm: Remove EWasm backend.
- Parser: Introduce `pragma experimental solidity`, which will enable an
  experimental language mode that, in particular, has no stability guarantees
  between non-breaking releases and is not suited for production use.
- SMTChecker: Add `--model-checker-print-query` CLI option and
  `settings.modelChecker.printQuery` JSON option to output the SMTChecker
  queries in the SMTLIB2 format. This requires using `smtlib2` solver only.
- Standard JSON Interface: Add `ast` file-level output for Yul input.
- Standard JSON Interface: Add `irAst` and `irOptimizedAst` contract-level
  outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and
  optimized IR.
- Yul Optimizer: Remove experimental `ReasoningBasedSimplifier` optimization
  step.
- Yul Optimizer: Stack-to-memory mover is now enabled by default whenever
  possible for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.

### Bugfixes

- Code Generator: Disallow complex expressions whose results are types,
  built-ins, modules or some unassignable functions. The legacy code generation
  pipeline would not actually evaluate them, discarding any side effects they
  might have.
- Code Generator: Fix not entirely deterministic order of functions in
  unoptimized Yul output. The choice of C++ compiler in some cases would result
  in different (but equivalent) bytecode (especially from native binaries vs
  emscripten binaries).
- Commandline Interface: Fix internal error when using `--stop-after parsing`
  and requesting some of the outputs that require full analysis or compilation.
- Commandline Interface: It is no longer possible to specify both
  `--optimize-yul` and `--no-optimize-yul` at the same time.
- SMTChecker: Fix encoding of side-effects inside `if` and
  `ternary conditional`statements in the BMC engine.
- SMTChecker: Fix false negative when a verification target can be violated only
  by a trusted external call from another public function.
- SMTChecker: Fix generation of invalid SMT-LIB2 scripts in BMC engine with
  trusted mode for external calls when CHC engine times out.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by incorrectly classifying external
  function call using function pointer as a public getter.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by using an external identifier to
  encode member access to functions that take an internal function as a
  parameter.
- Standard JSON Interface: Fix an incomplete AST being returned when the
  analysis is interrupted by certain kinds of fatal errors.
- Type Checker: Disallow using certain unassignable function types in complex
  expressions.
- Type Checker: Function declaration types referring to different declarations
  are no longer convertible to each other.
- Yul Optimizer: Ensure that the assignment of memory slots for variables moved
  to memory does not depend on AST IDs that may depend on whether additional
  files are included during compilation.
- Yul Optimizer: Fix `FullInliner` step not ignoring code that is not in
  expression-split form.
- Yul Optimizer: Fix optimized IR being unnecessarily passed through the Yul
  optimizer again before bytecode generation.

### AST Changes

- AST: Add the `experimentalSolidity` field to the `SourceUnit` nodes, which
  indicates whether the experimental parsing mode has been enabled via
  `pragma experimental solidity`.
