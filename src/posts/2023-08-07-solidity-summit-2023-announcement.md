The [Solidity Summit](/summit/) has returned! Following the popularity of the [Solidity Summit in 2022](/blog/2022/05/03/solidity-summit-2022-recap/), we are pleased to announce a live event for 2023!

Solidity Summit 2023 is part of [DevConnect](https://devconnect.org/) and will take place in Istanbul, Turkey, on Wednesday, November 16, 2023.

## What can you expect for the Solidity Summit?

The Solidity Summit is a collaborative conference that focuses on Solidity's future. It is a gathering of advanced Solidity users and other Solidity ecosystem stakeholders such as language designers, tool builders, auditors, and security researchers.

During the event you will:
- Find out more about the most recent language proposals and new features.
- Hear what's new from Solidity tooling and security researchers.
- Learn from Solidity experts.

## Speaker applications are open now!
The call for speakers is open! To apply for a speaking opportunity, please complete [the speaker form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/GMGhskSUobJs5pg5ZZ-l0I75kfVKdvIR0L-B0DSDxRk/).

Keep in mind that the Solidity Summit is geared towards an experienced audience, which means you can get "deep" into the Solidity weeds or technical things!

### Who is a good fit for a talk at the Solidity Summit?

- (Solidity) Language Shapers: Experts in Solidity, or other EVM smart contract languages, can share updates, or present improvement ideas and their thoughts.
- Toolmakers: IDE developers, debuggers, analysis tools, or testing frameworks can use this occasion to share updates with the audience.
- Auditors and Security Researchers: Relevant tips, common mistakes, insights from audits, or suggestions to share are welcome!
- Solidity Power Users: Big Solidity users can share their finest Solidity hacks, tips, and comments!
